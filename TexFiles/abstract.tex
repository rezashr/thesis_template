\unnumberedchapter{Abstract}

This is an example of abstract for thesis. You can use abbreviations such as {`\textbackslash ab\{eeg\}'} resulting in \ab{eeg}  or {`\textbackslash Ab\{eog\}'}, i.e., \Ab{eog}, to use capital for the starting letter. Using them again {`\textbackslash ab\{eeg\}'} will result in \ab{eeg} short version only.
