\chapter{Conclusion} \label{chap:conclusion}

As mentioned in \cref{chap:aim}, you can create equations and refer to them \cref{eq:1}. You can also refer to multiple equations, which cref will shorten them for you. For example, \cref{eq:1,eq:2}. Extended version is like \cref{eq:1,eq:2,eq:3} \citep{Shoorangiz2016}. \cite{Baseer2017} is a very good paper.


\begin{align}
	A & = B + 2 \label{eq:1}\\
	B & = C - 2 \label{eq:2}
\end{align}

\begin{align}
	D & = \nicefrac{3}{2} \label{eq:3}
\end{align}
